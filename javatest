-----------------Java Test--------------------------

1. which sorted collection have you used?

collection.sort ,comparable and comparators we are using the sorted collection.

2.what is difference between linked list and array list?

               Arry list                                         linked list
			   
	1. array list internaly store dynamic                  1. linked list internaly store circular list arry
	    arry in the element.                                   in the element.
		
	2. Array list is using the faster read operation.       2.  linked list is slower in read operation.

   3. array	list slower in write operation.                3. linked list is faster in write operation.
 
   4. This class implements a List interface               4.This class implements both the List interface and the Deque interface 
        Therefore this acts as a list.                         Therefore it can act as a list and a deque.
    
      	

3.what is diffreence between listiterator and iterator.

                Iterator          		                            ListIterator
				
	1. Iterator is an interface in Java                  1.ListIterator is an interface that extends the Iterator
	and we can traverse the elements of a list              interface and we can traverse the elements
	  in a forward direction.			                       in both forward and backward directions.
	  
	  
	2. Iterator can be used in these collection         2.ListIterator can be used in List collection only. 
	    types like List, Set, and Queue. 

    3. methods of Iterator interface are hasNext()     3. ListIterator interface are add()
	      next() and remove() 	                          hasNext() hasPrevious() and remove().
		  
		  

4. what are some Alternative to inheritance	
   Delegation is an alternative to inheritance Delegation means that you include an instance 
     of another class as an instance variable.
	 
	 
5.what is the coveriant method overloading.

Covariant Method overloading means that when overloading a method in the child class
 the return type of an overloadinhg method without any need to cast the type or check the return type
 Covariant return type works only for non-primitive return types. 
 
 6. what is memory leakege in java?
 
 The memory leak is a situation when the garbage collector does not recognize the unused objects 
 and they remain in the memory indefinitely that reduces the amount of memory allocated to the application.
 
 7. explaning static binding and instance binding in polymerphisum
 
 polymerphisum :- an object is behaves in given instance of time is called polymerphisum.
 two type of polymerphisum 
 1. complie time polymerphisum:- method overloading
 2. run time polymerphisum :- method overriding
 
 method overriding:- method overloading means multiple methods in the class method name will be same
                      difference in the parameter list is called method overloading.
					

method overriding:- in two class method signataure will be same difference in the implmention is called
                       method overriding.
					   

8. input [45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454]
    output:min-> 23
       	   max-> 900
	
	class Array
	{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
	int a[]={45,333,76,29,23,474,654,29,454};
	int max=a[0];
	int temp=0;
	for(int i=0; i<a.length; i++)
	{
	 for(int j=i+1; j<a.length;j++)
	 {
	 if(a[i]>a[j] && a.max[i])
	 {
	   max=a[i];
	 temp=a[i];
	 a[i]=a[j];
	 a[j]=temp;
	 }
	 }
	 }
	 System.out.println(max);
	 System.out.println(a[a.lenth-1]);
	 }
	 }
