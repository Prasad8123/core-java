                java test
                ---------

1. Explain JRE,JDK,JVM

JRE:- java runtime environment is called jre.jre is a set of libraries and other componets which are required to
        run the java program.
JDK:- java development kit is called jdk. jdk contains set of tools which are used for developing java program.
JVM:- java virtual machine is called jvm. jvm it is three contains that is loads the byte code and verify the
         byte code and execute the byte code of a java program.
	  
	  
2. explain the following 
  1. class ,object,static , public, private keywords.

  class:-class is contains  a states and behaviours is called class.
  object:- object is called instance of class.
  static:- static is a keyword and  non access modifier of the main method in program.
  public :- public is a access modifier of the main method in program.
  
  2.public static void main(String a[])
  
  in every java program we are using main method. without main method we can't run the java program.and 
  main method is actualy required for run time not complie time.  
  
  
  3. system.out.println()
  
  in above statment is called print statment in the java program. system.out mens a class name and println mens method name.

3.what is an array?

array is a container it group of elements having similar data type is stored in a memory.

  
	4. write a program
      given array number [] ={23,45,56,67,8,12,3,5,7,9,102,34,4,5}

     1.count the number of prime numbers in the given array.
     2.display the even number with count and odd number with count the given array.
     3. display the array size.
	 
	 
	 class Array
	 {
	 
	 public static void main(String a[])
	 {
	 
	 int a1[]= {23,45,56,67,8,12,3,5,7,9,102,34,4,5};
	 int odd=0;
	 int even =0;
	 
	 for(int i=0; i< a1.length ;i++)
	 {
		 if(a1[i] % 2 == 0)
		 {
			 even++;
		 }
		 else {
			 odd++;
		 }
		
	 }
	 System.out.println("given array");
	 for (int i=0; i<a1.length ; i++)
	 {
		 System.out.print(a1[i] + " " );
	 }
	 
	 System.out.println("count the no of even no " +even);
	 System.out.println("count the no of odd no " +odd);	 
	 }
	 }

5. explain the data types in java and give example for each.

data types are 8

byte:-byte is a data type its contains 4 bytes of data decleare in java program. ex:- byte b =0.5;
char:- char is a data type its contains 4 bytes of data declear sigle digit of character in java program. ex:- char c='c';
short:- short is a data type its contains 4 bytes of data declear number in program ex:- short s= 1;
String :- String is a data type its 8 bytes of data  declere String s="data";
int :- integer data type contains 8 bytes of data is declre ex:- int n=123;
float :- float contains 16 bytes of data  declare ex:- float f= 0.0647f;
double :-  double contains 16 bytes of data  declare ex:- float f= 0.3642d;
boolean :- boolean its contains 2 bytes of data is true or false ex:- boolean b= true;


6. what is variable? explain its types with an examples.

variable is a container its repesented to elements grouped to gether to perform a opeartion.
4 types of variables
local variables 
static variables
instance variables
parameter variables

7.what is constructor? when is the class constructor invoked ? will a class contain multiple constructor ?
 explain its types with an examples.
 
 it is a special type of method which will be same name as a class name with no return type.
 constructor types
 default constructor
 parameterized constructor
 
 default constructor
 
 example 
   
   class name()
   {
     System.out.println("default constructor is called");
   }
   
   parameterized constructor
   example 
   
  public  class name(String a, int n)
  {
  System.out.println("parameterized constructor is called");
  }
   
 
 8.explain java feactures.
 
 *) simple
 *)security
 *)paltform independent
 *)multi theraded

9 write a program to get the sum of digits

class Sum
{

public static void main(String a[])
{
int num ,x;
int sum=0;

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("enter the number");

num=sc.nextInt();
while(num >=0)

{

x=num%10;
sum=sum + x;
num=num/10;
}

System.out.println("sum of digit " + sum);
}
}


10) write a program to get the factorial of a given number

class Factorial
{

public static void main(String a[])
{
int n,fact=1;

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("enter the number");

n=sc.nextInt();

for(int i=1; i<=n ;i++)

{

fact=fact *i;
}

System.out.println("factorial of " + n + "is" +fact);
}
}
